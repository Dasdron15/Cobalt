# Cobalt
**Cobalt** is a minimalistic and modern terminal-based code editor written in C using the `ncurses` library. It provides essential text editing features, while remaining lightweight and easy to use.

## Background 
I wanted to create an intuitive terminal-based editor. While there's `nano`, I didn't really like its very limited set of features. So, I decided to build a code editor that combines nano's simplicity with vim's functionality.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Dasdron15/Cobalt
    cd cobalt
    ```
2. Compile the project using `make`
    ```bash
    make
    ```
3. Run the editor
    ```bash
    ./cobalt
    ```
